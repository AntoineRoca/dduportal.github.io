== Defining the "Continuous World"

This section describes the differences and use cases for:

* Continuous Integration
* Continuous Delivery
* Continuous Deployment

== Continuous Integration (CI)

== Why Use Continuous Integration ?

Allows a team to develop cohesive software more rapidly

[quote, Martin Fowler]
____
Continuous Integration doesn’t get rid of bugs, but it does make them dramatically easier to find and remove.
____

== What is Continuous Integration (CI) ?

[quote, Martin Fowler - Continuous Integration]
____
Continuous Integration is a software development *practice* where members of a team
integrate their work *frequently*. Usually each person integrates at least daily -
leading to *multiple* integrations per day.
____

== How to do Continuous Integration ?

* Each integration is verified by an *automated* build (including test)
* Integrate code *often*, at least daily, to make integration a *non-event*
* *Continuously* build and integrate
** Trigger builds automatically based on commit and merge actions and success of upstream builds

== Continuous Delivery (CD)

== Why use Continuous Delivery ?

[quote]
____
How long would it take to your organization to deploy a change that
involves just one single line of code?
____

* Reduce deployment risks
* Allow more frequent user feedback
* Make progress observable for everyone

== What is Continuous Delivery ?

Continuous Delivery is the next step after Continuous Integration:

* Each change to the system *can* be released for *production*
* Delivery can be done at *any* time, on *any* environment
* CD Pipeline produces a validated deployable artifact

[quote, Martin Fowler]
____
Your team prioritizes keeping the software *deployable* over working on new features
____

== How to do Continuous Delivery ?

* Have a collaborative working relationship with *everyone* involved
** DevOps is a popular model i.e. 2 Pizza Team
* Use *Delivery Pipelines*, which are automated implementations of
your application’s build lifecycle process.
This is discussed more later in this course.

== Continuous Deployment

== What is Continuous Deployment ?

* Continuous Deployment is the last step after Continuous Delivery.
** Used by Amazon and Netflix
* *Any change* to the system is automatically pushed to *production*.
** Not appropriate in all scenarios

== Continuous Delivery versus Deployment

These two terms are easily confused:

* Continuous Delivery needs a *manual* step before it is deployed to production.
* Continuous Deployment deploys the modified and tested software to production automatically.
** Full automated testing and reporting is essential to trusting Continuous Deployment

== What did we learn ?

* Continuous Integration (CI) is the frequent automatic integration of code
* Continuous Delivery (CD) is the natural extension of CI. It focuses on ensuring the code
is always ready to be deployed, although manual intervention is required to
actually deploy the software.
* Continuous Deployment is the next step, automatically deploy any changes to
production
