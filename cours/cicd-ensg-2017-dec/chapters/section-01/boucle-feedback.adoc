= The Feedback loop

// * Notifications:
// * KPIs/metrics for CI/CD (the DevOps feedback loop)

== Why have a Feedback Loop ?

* _Context:_ Continuous Delivery implemented with CD Pipeline
* _Target:_ Focusing on fast feedback to react quickly
* *Need* systems that give *quick* feedback to pipeline's *actors*
** Key to success on the _efficiency_ rule
** Give *confidence* to the actor: they know when when it breaks

== What is a Feedback loop ?

* The feedback loop is the set of tools that:
** Provides *status* of each step of the pipeline
** Gives the *right* message to the *right* actor of the pipeline
** Is also a great source of *measurements*

== How to Implement a Feedback Loop ?

* Start by evaluating:
** Which *actors* ? (Developers, Operation, Project Manager, Business)
** Which communication *media* ? (Direct Visualization, E-Mail, IRC, Collaboration chats, Video messaging, link:http://www.papercut.com/blog/chris/2011/08/19/who-broke-the-build/[Extreme Feedback Devices])
** Which *triggers*, _priorities_, frequencies and limits ? (Stage status change, Mail gray-listing, Production feedback vs. testing feedback)

== Measuring the pipeline: KPIs and Metrics

* Goal of a pipeline is to provide model for the value stream:
** Each stage has a _Value added time_
** Each gate has an _elapsed time_
* Keeping feedback on those values is *mandatory* to ensure value is still there
* Adding feedback metrics to pipeline metrics helps you:
** Provides information to Business
** Helps technical choices
** Avoids over-optimization

== What did we learn ?

* Having a pipeline is not enough: you need feedback
* Feedback targets different actors in many ways
* Feedback improves the measurements of your value stream mapping
* Fast feedback helps to focus on fail fast
