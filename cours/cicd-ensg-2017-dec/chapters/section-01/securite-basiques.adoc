== Why do Security ?

* Your organization uses _information_ to create value
* Information is valuable and *must* follow:
** Confidentiality
** Integrity
** Availability
* Implementing *Security* practices envorce those rules

== What is Security ?

* Security is the set of practices and tools to fight and prevent *threats*
* It's all about following those principles:
** *Know the system*
** *Least privilege:* If you do not need to do it, you do not have the right to do it.
** *Defense in Depth:* Systems are layered. Put security on all layers.
** *Preventing is good. Detection is better:* Continuous monitoring and detection.

== How to do security ? Least privilege

* Handling "Least privileges" concepts makes you manage the *AAA* concepts:
** Authentication
** Authorization
** Accounting

== Authentication

* Authentication is the set of tools and procedures that *identify*
a user with _enough confidence_
** When police check your ID, it is authentication
** Using a login and a password is an authentication
** Biometrics are also a type of authentication
** 2FA, that stands for "Two Factor Authentication" is a stronger authentication scheme

== Authorization

* Once a given user is _authenticated_, need to determine the actions
this user should have the right to do
* *Authorization* always occurs in the context of _authentication_
* Authorization grants access rights to:
** *Resources:* Tasks, objects and/or actions to manipulate
** *Roles:* A set of rights grouped together by commodity
** *Requesters:* User or group that has roles assigned,
and wants to manipulates resources
* It is easy to visualize and enforce with a *Security Matrix*

== Accounting

* Occurs in the context of a user both *authenticated* and *authorized*.
* It *measures* resources used or consumed by the user during access.
* This can be amount of data, compute resources, or system time.
* It enforces *limits* when they are defined to protect system.
* Related to system measurement, *capacity planning* and feedback loops

== How to do security ? Defense in Depth:

* Defense in Depth is not an easy subject,
but we are focusing on the *Credentials*
** Given the previous AAA context
** A lot of systems for stages of pipelines (SCM, CI Server, Environment, WebServices, etc.)
** How to enforce homogeneity of AAA ?
* *Credential management* is the practices and tools that avoid leaking authentication
information to non authorized users.

== How to do security ? Detection is better

* Security has to be *meta*: how to enforce security itself ?
* *Auditing* the security processes and system is a method to *validate* them.
* It can be seen as a type of Acceptance Testing:
** Needs to be run continuously
** Should be done by someone other than the user being audited
** It can be related to external certification for external confidence (e.g. PCI)

== What did we learn ?

* Security is a required discipline that must be taken into account
from the beginning
* It is a large subject but enforcing the rules is a big win
* Implementing AAA framework is a good way to start
* Security is related to feedback: which action to take when a problem arises ?
* Measurement is not an option, but a must have
